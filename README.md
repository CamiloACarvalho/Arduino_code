# Codes I used in my tcc 👨🏼‍🎓😵

Hi everyone! How are you? I hope that fine! I'm glad that you came again! So, enjoy!
<br>
<br>
This project I had developed to my undergraduate thesis and now I decided share with you!
<br>
There are two code. An I used to collect weather data through arduino and the other code I created for use in the Engineering Equation Solver (EES) software which is a commercial software package used for solving systems of simultaneous nonlinear equations
